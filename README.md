# 📧 Email Extraction Automation
This project focuses on automating a common real-life repetitive task using Python. The script extracts all valid email addresses from a plain text (`.txt`) file and saves them into a separate output file. Manually scanning large text files for email addresses is inefficient and error-prone. This automation simplifies the process using Python file handling and regular expressions, making it suitable for processing documents, logs, or exported data.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Automate the extraction of email addresses from a text file and store them in a separate file such as `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.log` for easy reuse.

---

## ⭐ Features
- Reading data from a `.txt` file
- Extracting valid email addresses using regular expressions
- Automatic removal of duplicate email entries
- Saving extracted emails into a separate output file
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python script
- Basic error handling

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- File handling
- Regular expressions using the `re` module
- Sets for duplicate removal
- Basic Python scripting

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language :** Python 3.x
- **Library Used :** `re` (Regular Expressions)

---
## ⚙️ Requirements
- Installed Python 3.x on the system

---

## 🚀 Deployment
This is a local Python script and does not require deployment. It can be executed on any system with Python installed.

---
## ⚡ Optimizations
- Uses a set to remove duplicate emails efficiently
- Can be optimized further by reading large files line-by-line instead of loading the entire file at once

---
## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Working with regular expressions for pattern matching
- Handling files safely using Python
- Automating repetitive tasks using simple scripts
- Structuring small automation projects professionally

---
## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Support reading large files line-by-line
- Export results in CSV or JSON format
- Improve regex for advanced email patterns
- Add command-line arguments for file names

---
## 📄 Documentation
The project follows a simple and readable structure. The script is short and self-explanatory, with clear function naming and logical flow. Detailed usage instructions and examples are provided in this `README.md`.

## ❓ FAQ
#### Q1. Does this script generate email addresses?
**Answer.** No. It only extracts existing email addresses from a `.txt` file.
#### Q2. What happens if the input.txt file has no emails?
**Answer.** The output file will be empty.
#### Q3. Where is the output file saved?
**Answer.** In the same directory where the script is executed.
